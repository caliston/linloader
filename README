Linloader 0.40
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linloader is RISC OS command line program for booting Linux on Acorn
RiscPCs, RiscStations, Bush STBs and Castle's Iyonix. It does not provide a
boot menu, or shut down the desktop. Linloader is released under the GNU GPL,
see the file Docs.GPL/txt and is © Timothy Baldwin and others.

Full documentation can be found in the Docs directory.

These sources have been modified to use a modern OSLib distribution
They require a Norcroft linked zlib, source for which can be obtained
from: http://www.kyllikki.org

This is broken for Bush STB in that they assume an 8MB memory SIMM and
pass values to ARM Linux accordingly.


Versions
~~~~~~~~

Linloader is now maintained by Vincent Sanders, taking the original
0.35 version and updating it for RiscStation support, as well
as improving comments.

Peter Naulls added support for Castle's Iyonix, and cleaned the
code up, and added more comments.
