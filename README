Linloader 0.40
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linloader is RISC OS command line program for booting Linux on Acorn
RiscPCs, RiscStations, Bush STBs and Castle's Iyonix. It does not provide a
boot menu, or shut down the desktop. Linloader is released under the GNU GPL,
see the file Docs.GPL/txt and is © Timothy Baldwin and others.

Full documentation can be found in the Docs directory.

These sources have been modified to use a modern OSLib distribution
They require a Norcroft linked zlib, source for which can be obtained
from: http://www.kyllikki.org

This is broken for Bush STB in that they assume an 8MB memory SIMM and
pass values to ARM Linux accordingly.
